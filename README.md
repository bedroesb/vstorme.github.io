## Welcome to the Biostatistics Page of the Plant Systems Biology Department

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vstorme/vstorme.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This site provides links to some basic statistical information and hosts slides and demo code from various workshops given in the Department.
