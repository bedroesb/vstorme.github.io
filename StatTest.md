## Choosing the correct Statistical Test

The [UCLA](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/) provides a nice overview with additional information on how to do it 
in SAS, SPSS, Stata and R.

When [your dependent variable is not fit for a linear model](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/when-dependent-variables-are-not-fit-for-glm-now-what/),
other (advanced) options are available.

**Repeated measures** are obtained whenever an outcome is measured repeatedly within a set of units. The fact that observations from the 
same unit, in general, will not be independent poses particular challenges to the statistical procedures used for the analysis of 
such data. When a given subject is measured repeatedly over time, the data is said to be longitudinal. 
Another example of repeated measures is leaf series data. This is also called multilevel or hieararchical data because the leaves 
are nested within plants. These data are typically analysed with mixed models. Also experiments that are repeated are considered multilevel.
